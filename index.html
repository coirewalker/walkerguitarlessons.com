                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>My name is Coire Walker, and I love to balance music's technical, creative, and theoretical elements to build my students into innovative, well-rounded guitarists. Being able to convey lesson concepts makes a good teacher, but knowing how to identify and manifest a student's potential makes a great one. I aspire to the latter, relying on student feedback to guide us. Lessons are low-pressure, fun, and all ages welcome. 
                        </p>
                        <p>If you are new to the guitar, I will teach you foundational playing techniques with small amounts of music theory. We will develop a practice routine that caters to your curiosity by balancing technical and creative elements and working towards creating a musical mindset free of negativity. If you have some experience, I can offer new perspectives, theoretical context, and challenges. The guitar has been my instrument for twenty-five years, and I have been teaching professionally for seventeen. Teaching music is my primary occupation, and it suits me well; the long-term relationships forged and the medium used could not be more rewarding.
                        </p>
                        <p>My music degree is from the Musicians Institute in Los Angeles, CA.
                        </p>

                        <p class="quote quote-spacer">"Coire quickly became the best guitar teacher I've ever had by really understanding my musical goals. He helped me develop skills to reach those goals by using music I was interested in and exercises that challenged my comfort zone."<br>- Max D.

                        <p>I am offering in-person lessons on the Olympic Peninsula and online via Zoom. Learn about how I have made lessons on Zoom highly effective <a href="/do-remote-guitar-lessons-on-zoom-skype-facetime-work.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>I encourage prospective students to share a thoughtfully constructed playlist with me. I want to understand what you love most about music and where you want to improve. How do you see yourself three, six, and twelve months after beginning our lessons? What are your strengths and weaknesses as a player? How do you learn most effectively, and what structure will you need to succeed? 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>I teach all guitar styles except advanced jazz and classical (these two require a different discipline, and I do not claim to have mastery of them). I am comfortable with contemporary styles ranging from classic and hard rock to funk and soul to fingerstyle and folk. Lesson topics include songwriting, reading, ear training, strumming and picking techniques, singing and playing simultaneously, soloing, and composition. Framing lessons in their underlying theory is especially rewarding. Sometimes I even have the honor of helping students with live performances and personal pieces.  
                        </p>

He allows you to submit songs you would like to work towards so that classes are rewarding and you learn songs you actually want to play. He makes guitar both approachable and enjoyable!"<br>- Brittany B.

                        <p>Teaching music is a tremendous privilege and responsibility, and I take my job very seriously even though my lessons are relaxed. As a student, you will have a personal folder in Google Drive containing relevant lesson materials, including homework, notation, exercises, links, and demonstration videos I create. Documenting this way takes time, but having these resources available makes a robust framework for at-home study. Consider lessons with me like a personal college course tailored to your interests.     
                        </p>
                        <p>I have had many jobs and careers, but I always return to music. There is a freedom in playing the guitar that is unlike anything else I have experienced. As a teacher, my primary objective is to bring out your potential, technically and creatively, so you can share this freedom yourself.
                        </p>

	                    <p>Lesson rates are $85/60min, $65/45min, and $50/30min. Sixty minutes is optimal for reviewing material, answering questions, and exploring new objectives together, but we can still get a lot done in forty-five minutes. Thirty-minute sessions are best for children and students who can come focused and prepared for smaller steps. If you have any reservations about the remote format, I am happy to meet with you free of charge to answer any questions you might have. If you want to jump right in, the first lesson is half-price. I accept Venmo, Paypal, ApplePay, and cash for payment.
