                        <h2>Lessons</h2> 
                        <p>
                            My music degree is from Musicians Institute (MI) in Los Angeles, CA. While attending MI, I had the honor of studying under world-class guitarists like Paul Gilbert, Alan Holdsworth, Alan Hinds, Ross Bolton, Dan Gilbert, Al Bonhomme, David Oakes, Dale Turner, and Travis Carlton.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lessons are given in Port Angeles at Peninsula Music and on Zoom worldwide. I am very organized and work to develop practical structures and approaches that provide results. I use Google Drive for student collaboration, practice routines, notation/tabs, and demonstration videos I create as study guides. Having all lesson content available provides a robust study framework that is highly organized and accessible from anywhere. Although I go into each lesson with an informal plan, student feedback determines how we move forward. Growth is dynamic, and so is the approach. Effective practice structures deliver results at home. Having my students understand the connection between technical and theoretical aspects in a way that allows a healthy, self-examined, and adventurous relationship with music is what I strive to accomplish.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            I am happy to meet you for a phone or video chat to answer questions and see if we are a good fit. Weekly lessons are ideal, but we can meet whenever you are available. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Here is an <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> section.
                        </p>

                        <h4>What to expect as a beginner</h4>
                        <p>
                            If you are a beginning player, my primary objective is to provide you with the structure required, familiarize you with the instrument, and nurture your curiosity. You will learn playing fundamentals and how to approach practice with a positive mindset. During our first session, we will get to know each other, assess your goals, break ground on your practice routine, and give you something simple to start playing on your guitar. It's fun, I promise! My goal is to have you leave our first session with a sense that learning to play guitar is not only possible but an enriching challenge.
                        </p>
                        <h4>What to expect as an experienced player</h4>
                        <p>
                            If you have some experience with guitar, what we decide to work on together depends on your goals. Where are you stuck? Do you need help with your rhythm? Are YouTube videos creating more questions than answers? Do you want a more comprehensive understanding of music theory, ear training, or to write better songs? Maybe you can't put your finger on the issue, which is quite common. Whatever your reasons, I can teach you the tools and techniques to get unstuck. Perspective is everything.

                        <h2>Rates</h2>
                        <p>
                            Although I can afford to charge top rates for my lessons, I want to reach the people who need music most. Often, this is the person working three jobs trying to make rent or the kid in the punk band with big dreams. I was that kid, and I had no one to teach me (I wish I had). I believe that learning music should be accessible to everyone. For this reason, rates are on a <span>sliding scale</span>. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you can afford the upper rate, please pay it. If you can't afford that, so long as you are willing to work hard, I am happy to work with you at an affordable rate. Your success is most important to me. This decision is my way of giving back and making the world more equitable.
                        </p>

I always appreciated the way Coire custom-tailored each lesson, taking into account my personal taste in music, and my goals as a player. Equally important, Coire's just a great guy to hang out with. If you're going to put in the time to learn an instrument, you're inevitably going to spend a lot of time with your teacher. He gets a solid "A" on the good-hang factor. I highly recommend him."<br>- Nate F.

                            "As a person who had little to no experience with guitar, but always wanted to learn, I was nervous about where to start. Coire was happy to start lessons with me. Each lesson covers something new. Be it how to strum, read tabs, music theory, picking, Coire is helpful at every step. He has created lesson plans, notes, drills, practices, and helpful videos all tailored to my specific needs/goals. Coire is as patient as he is helpful. Easy to talk to and jam with. While everyone has their strengths, he’s been thoughtful in how I can improve in specific areas. Finding ways and giving me the tools to get better on my own. He’s been available to answer all my questions throughout the week if I get stuck or need assistance. The one and only downside is that the lessons go by so fast, but times flies when you’re having fun!"<br>- Zachary B.

After only a few lessons, he identified some bad habits I needed to work on - his advice was clear, and easy to implement.  Coming out of lessons, I’ll have both written tabs or chord charts he’s created, and snippets of videos illustrating his main points - it makes practicing the lessons easy. <br> I’ve had a ton more fun playing since I started studying under Coire, and I’m excited about where I’ll be in a year.

                            * I can bring a set of questions that range all over the map, and he'll work through them 
                            <br>
                            * He's been able to improve my strumming & fretting technique (including giving tips on muting and articulation) over zoom
                            <br>
                            * He's very patient, and able to explain concepts no matter their complexity clearly

                            * He's been able to help me take apart some complex songs by ear and break complex solos into manageable sections

As I'm still in my beginner stages, he's adapted to a lot of my needs without question, and helped to harness my focus as we continued lessons together. Wish he were still in NY, I would keep taking them."<br>- Rachael B.

First, he’s really good at explaining simple and more complicated lessons in ways that anybody will understand.  Second, he listens and figures out how to focus the class to address the student’s questions and the intended lesson.  Finally, he’s patient and adapts to shifting schedules.  Plus, his online classes feel like in-person ones.  Highly recommended."<br>- Guillermo S.

                            "Coire is an absolutely amazing teacher! First of all, he is extremely talented and can figure out any song by ear. As a result, we've had a lot of cool lessons where we deconstructed songs that wouldn't normally be played on the guitar and created new versions of them together, something I doubt a different teacher would have been so enthusiastic about. He is the type of teacher who encourages you to practice without ever telling you to because his love for music is so contagious. I would strongly recommend Coire as a teacher, especially if you're tired of learning by books and you want to jump into playing songs you love, even as a beginner. Learning guitar definitely does not need to be boring and does not require memorizing scales, and I think Coire epitomizes the type of teacher who makes music exciting."<br>- Neela E.

He is in tune with the individuals needs, and I needed that objectiveness for new ways of approaching the guitar, and sparking my motivation. We are working on bringing out the musician that is inside of me. Coire is very knowledgeable  about theory, and has methods that are "right on" to help you achieve your goals. It is the first time that an instructor will also follow up reinforcing the last lessen by providing you your own folder. I plan on continuing to move forward on my mission, and goals.

                            I was a beginner a few months ago, but thanks to Coire, I am now a master guitarist of multiple chords and tabs. <br> Coire is patient, knowledgeable, and friendly- he was even willing to help me pick out my perfect guitar. His explanations are easy to understand and he is very accommodating with all types of schedules. Due to my new job, I haven’t had much free time and I was worried that it would be impossible to fit in the guitar lessons into my schedules 😢, but Coire had a plan which worked for me ☺️. I contribute my new passion for guitar to him and would recommend him to anyone! <br>- Nicole

                            Coire is a great teacher. He took some songs I wanted to learn in a few different styles and helped me build techniques to grow and develop on my skills to be able to grow on a weekly cadence in each session. He tailored each week to build on the techniques from the previous week. Not only was he able to teach and build on each week, he was a blast to work with each week and I looked forward to my lessons each week. I would highly recommend Coire to anyone who is trying to learn how to play the guitar. <br>- Harvey C.

Coire is a very fun and uplifting teacher to have who is always on pace with the student to not overwhelm them too much. On top of that Coire is just an all around great guy who you can just have a chat about anything, not just guitar. I’m glad to have Coire as my teacher and I hope many others can feel the same way. <br>- Kevin

I was worried about how difficult it would be to pick up an instrument through Zoom lessons, but I have already learned so much from him. He provides extremely detailed explanations and structures the lessons to my needs as a song writer.

Coire tailors the lessons towards the songs you want to learn, suggests exercises to do on your own during practice, and is very patient in his instructions!

He helps hone in on motivators and the more nuanced elements of learning, in addition to the practical aspects.  I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to either learn from the beginning, as with me, or someone more advanced and looking to supplement their knowledge. <br>- Becca J.
