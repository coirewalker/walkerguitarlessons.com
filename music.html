            <p>Many years later I am still rehashing this one, the challenge being “how can I play everything I hear?"  I only have two hands.  I only have one instrument.  I am not looking for strength in virtuosity, in quantity, complexity or frequency--those automatic things we go to as musicians all too often.  There is nothing new to discover in those places.  However, I am searching to find the path to 'lost' within the <em>frequency</em>, to force myself to hear the things that I did not (or could not) play, those things present within music that as listeners we translate to feeling when hearing a song for the first time--that rush to the head, the vivid imagery, the total immersion…
            </p>  
            <p>There were times before we made music into chords and theories and placed them into books and boxes and packages and cages.  We thought that in making the experience of feeling music tangible we could somehow absorb it fully.  In this desire to understand we unrolled the mystery and lost what we loved in the first place.  You cannot hold the ghost. 
            </p>
            <p>My objective is the same as always, although this time I'm revisiting as an old lover and friend, listening attentively to where she has been, and how she has changed, instead of waiting for my turn to speak.  Here are my rough thoughts on that. </p>
