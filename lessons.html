                        <h2>Lessons</h2> 
                        <p>
                            My music degree is from Musicians Institute (MI) in Los Angeles, CA. While attending MI, I had the honor of studying under world-class guitarists like Paul Gilbert, Alan Holdsworth, Alan Hinds, Ross Bolton, Dan Gilbert, Al Bonhomme, David Oakes, and Dale Turner.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lessons are given worldwide via Zoom. I am very organized and work to develop practical structures and approaches that provide results. I use Google Drive for student collaboration, practice routines, notation/tabs, and demonstration videos I create as study guides. Having all lesson content available provides a robust study framework that is highly organized and accessible from anywhere. Although I go into each lesson with an informal plan, student feedback determines how we move forward. Growth is dynamic, and so is the approach. Effective practice structures deliver results at home. Having my students understand the connection between technical and theoretical aspects in a way that allows a healthy, self-examined, and adventurous relationship with music is what I strive to accomplish.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            I am happy to meet you for a phone or video chat to answer questions and see if we are a good fit. Weekly lessons are ideal and provide the best results, but we can meet whenever you are available. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Here is an <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> section.
                        </p>

                        <h4>What to expect as a beginner</h4>
                        <p>
                            If you are a beginning player, my primary objective is to provide you with the structure required, familiarize you with the instrument, and nurture your curiosity. You will learn playing fundamentals and how to approach practice with a positive mindset. During our first session, we will get to know each other, assess your goals, break ground on your practice routine, and give you something simple to start playing on your guitar. It's fun, I promise! My goal is to have you leave our first session with a sense that learning to play guitar is not only possible but an enriching challenge.
                        </p>
                        <h4>What to expect as an experienced player</h4>
                        <p>
                            If you have some experience with guitar, what we decide to work on together depends on your goals. Where are you stuck? Do you need help with your rhythm? Are YouTube videos creating more questions than answers? Do you want a more comprehensive understanding of music theory, ear training, or to write better songs? Maybe you can't put your finger on the issue, which is quite common. Whatever your reasons, I can teach you the tools and techniques to get unstuck. Perspective is everything.

        <section id="booking" class="container content-section text-center col-lg-12">
            <div class="booking-section">

                        <h2>Rates</h2>
                        <p>
                            Although I can afford to charge top rates for my lessons, I want to reach the people who need music most. Often, this is the person working three jobs trying to make rent or the kid in the punk band with big dreams. I was that kid, and I had no one to teach me (I wish I had). I believe that learning music should be accessible to everyone. For this reason, rates are on a sliding scale. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you can afford the upper rate, please pay it. If you can't afford that, so long as you are willing to work hard, I am happy to work with you at an affordable rate. Your success is most important to me. This decision is my way of giving back and making the world more equitable.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Sliding Scale:</h3>
                        <p class="para-center">
                            60min: $55-85<br>
                            45min: $35-65<br>
                            30min: $25-45   
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A sixty-minute lesson is optimal for reviewing material, answering questions, and exploring new objectives together, but we can still accomplish a lot in forty-five minutes. Thirty minutes is good for younger students and those who want to take smaller steps.
                        </p>

I always appreciated the way Coire custom-tailored each lesson, taking into account my personal taste in music, and my goals as a player. Equally important, Coire's just a great guy to hang out with. If you're going to put in the time to learn an instrument, you're inevitably going to spend a lot of time with your teacher. He gets a solid "A" on the good-hang factor. I highly recommend him."<br>- Nate F.

                            "As a person who had little to no experience with guitar, but always wanted to learn, I was nervous about where to start. Coire was happy to start lessons with me. Each lesson covers something new. Be it how to strum, read tabs, music theory, picking, Coire is helpful at every step. He has created lesson plans, notes, drills, practices, and helpful videos all tailored to my specific needs/goals. Coire is as patient as he is helpful. Easy to talk to and jam with. While everyone has their strengths, he’s been thoughtful in how I can improve in specific areas. Finding ways and giving me the tools to get better on my own. He’s been available to answer all my questions throughout the week if I get stuck or need assistance. The one and only downside is that the lessons go by so fast, but times flies when you’re having fun!"<br>- Zachary B.

After only a few lessons, he identified some bad habits I needed to work on - his advice was clear, and easy to implement.  Coming out of lessons, I’ll have both written tabs or chord charts he’s created, and snippets of videos illustrating his main points - it makes practicing the lessons easy. <br> I’ve had a ton more fun playing since I started studying under Coire, and I’m excited about where I’ll be in a year.

                            * I can bring a set of questions that range all over the map, and he'll work through them 
                            <br>
                            * He's been able to improve my strumming & fretting technique (including giving tips on muting and articulation) over zoom
                            <br>
                            * He's very patient, and able to explain concepts no matter their complexity clearly

                            * He's been able to help me take apart some complex songs by ear and break complex solos into manageable sections

                            "Coire is patient, polite, and good-humored. He's really good at tuning into what you'd like to work on most. As I'm still in my beginner stages, he's adapted to a lot of my needs without question, and helped to harness my focus as we continued lessons together. Wish he were still in NY, I would keep taking them."<br>- Rachael B.
