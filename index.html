                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>My name is Coire Walker, and I will help you become the guitarist you want to be. I love to balance the technical, creative, and theoretical elements of music to build my students into innovative, well-rounded musicians. Lessons are low-pressure and fun, and all ages are welcome. If you are looking to pick up the guitar for the first time, I will teach you foundational playing techniques, small amounts of music theory, and work together with you to design a practice routine that addresses your needs. If you have plateaued with your playing, I can offer new perspectives, provide theoretical context, and share creative exercises to challenge you. I have been playing guitar for twenty-five years and teaching professionally for fifteen. This is my primary occupation and it suits me well; the long-term relationships forged and the medium used couldn't be more rewarding to me.
                        </p>
                        <p>Contact me to set up a lesson <a class="page-scroll" href="#contact">here</a>.</p>
                        <p>My <span>music degree</span> is from Musicians Institute in Los Angeles, CA.
                        </p>

                        <p>Currently, due to the pandemic, most of my lessons are provided online through <span>Zoom</span>. I encourage every new student to share a thoughtfully constructed playlist with me. I want to understand what you love most about music and where you want to grow. Where do you see yourself in three, six, and twelve months after beginning our lessons? What are your strengths and weaknesses as a player? How do you learn most effectively, and what structure will you need at home to succeed? What do you want to achieve by taking lessons with me?      
                        </p>

                        <p>I teach all <span>genres</span> of music except advanced jazz and classical guitar; these two are their own discipline, and I do not claim to have mastery of them, however, we can play with them as much as you like! I enjoy folk, fingerstyle, rock, shoegaze, funk, punk, blues, and many other styles. <span>Lesson topics</span> include songwriting, reading, ear training, strumming and picking techniques, singing and playing simultaneously, soloing, composition, and connecting the aforementioned topics to their underlying theory. Sometimes I even have the honor of helping students with live performing and personal compositions.

He allows you to submit songs you would like to work towards so that classes are rewarding and you learn songs you actually want to play.

                        <p>Teaching music is a tremendous privilege and responsibility, and I take my job very seriously even though I am relaxed in my lessons. As a student, you will have a personal folder in Google Drive containing relevant lesson work, including homework, notation, exercises, links, and demonstration videos I create. Documenting in this way takes time, but I have found that having this online framework available generates significantly better results from individual practice. There is a freedom in playing the guitar that is unlike anything else I have experienced, and as a teacher, it is my primary objective to help you succeed with this challenging and deeply rewarding instrument so you can experience this freedom for yourself.
