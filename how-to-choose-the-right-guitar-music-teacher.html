						<p><p>After my post discussing <a href="/do-remote-guitar-lessons-on-zoom-skype-facetime-work.html" target="_blank">remote guitar lessons</a>, I wanted to share how to choose a good music teacher. As a guitar instructor, I cannot speak about what it is like for other musical disciplines. Still, I see five main elements of any good teacher/student relationship: communication, style, values, expectations, and experience.
						</p>

						<div class="divider-1 div-transparent div-arrow-down"></div>
						
						<h3>Communication</h3>
						<p>Many great musicians are poor teachers, and many average musicians are great teachers. Teaching is a skill like any other. Look for someone who is structured, goal-oriented, efficient, and open-minded. Good teachers will be open to student feedback and ways of improving communication.
						</p>
						<p>Working with a good instructor should be enjoyable and challenging, but no matter how good they are, they cannot read your mind. As a student, you need to share how things are going. Good instructors have the wisdom to address problems from multiple angles, and they understand that your lessons are about your success, not them. 
						</p>
						
						<h3>Style</h3>
						<p>What teaching style and personality work for you? Do you prefer an explorative style or set songs and exercises? What type of student is the teacher looking for? Would you like to be influenced by this person over the long term? Can they bring out the best in you? 
						</p>
						<p>Consider your learning style. How much structure do you need? What has worked for you in the past, and what has not? Music is a labor of love. Are you willing to explore the best balance of vegetables and chocolate? What learning approach would challenge you and keep you inspired? Do you want homework assignments, or would you prefer to float freely exploring at your own pace? Get a sense of how you like to travel, and then find a teacher who is excited to help make it happen.
						</p>

						<h3>Values</h3>
						<p>How committed will the teacher be to your success? Do you want lessons from a touring musician with many wild stories who may not be around consistently (only looking to supplement their income), or would you prefer a teacher available for a more invested relationship? What overall impression of their character do you get from their online presence? Every teacher has to make a living, but do you feel they are genuinely committed to teaching, or will you be viewed simply as a source of income? Find someone who will invest equally in the working relationship you desire.
						</p>

						<h3>Expectations</h3>
						<p>A few things are required from you as a student. Be willing to commit to regular practice. Weekly lessons are the norm and initially provide good student accountability, but every other week can work for highly motivated individuals. If you practice five days a week, progress takes off! If you don't have that life structure and still want to learn, address this early with a prospective teacher. Many of my students live busy lives and make excellent progress over the long term. A good teacher can give you a practical, enjoyable routine while keeping you focused on enjoying the journey.
						</p>

						<h3>Experience</h3>
						<p>Consider character and professionalism. How experienced is the instructor, and is this observable? How do they relate to you? Do they appear genuinely focused on your goals? Are they supportive or inflexible? If you couldnâ€™t meet your weekly practice target, would they react with judgment or constructive solutions? Are they pursuing their growth on a personal level, or do they come across as the all-knowing guru with the magic method? (Red flag!)
						</p>
						<p>As a beginning player, you must show up with an open mind, communicate your thoughts, and give your best effort. If you have prior playing experience, give your teacher a few lessons to understand your background and goals. With the right instructor, taking lessons should feel like a labor of love. Every relationship is different, and that's the best part.
