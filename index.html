                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>My name is Coire Walker, and I love to balance music's technical, creative, and theoretical elements to help my students become innovative, well-rounded guitarists. The guitar has been my instrument for twenty-five years, and I have been teaching professionally for seventeen. Teaching music is my primary occupation, and it suits me well; the long-term relationships forged and the medium used could not be more rewarding. Lessons are low-pressure, fun, and all ages welcome.
                        </p>
                        <p>I am offering in-person lessons on the Olympic Peninsula and online via Zoom. Learn about how I have made Zoom highly effective for all my students <a href="/do-remote-guitar-lessons-on-zoom-skype-facetime-work.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                        </p>

                        <p>My music degree is from the Musicians Institute in Los Angeles, CA.</p>

                        <p class="quote">"Coire is a kind, fun, and patient teacher who meets you where you’re at with a wealth of knowledge and tips to help you improve. I leave every lesson feeling like I’ve learned so much and with practical next steps to apply to my playing. After just a few lessons I feel like I’m already making progress towards my guitar goals and I would highly recommend Coire if you’re considering guitar lessons!" <br>- Kristen S.
                        </p>
                        
                        <div id="zoom">
                            <div class="divider-1 div-transparent div-arrow-down"></div>
                        </div>

                        <p>If you are a beginning player, my primary objective is to get you familiar and confident with the instrument while nurturing your curiosity. I have plenty of productive approaches to learning playing fundamentals, creating healthy practice habits, and positively framing the experience. If you seek new perspectives, theoretical context, and challenges with your playing, I'd love to help you get excited again. I prefer to work with students on a long-term basis, but I am happy to help you for any length of time.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>I encourage prospective students to share a thoughtfully constructed playlist with me. I want to understand what you love most about music and where you want to improve. How do you see yourself three, six, and twelve months after beginning our lessons? What are your strengths and weaknesses as a player? How do you learn most effectively, and what structure will you need to succeed?
                        </p>
                        <p>I teach all guitar styles on acoustic and electric instruments, ranging from classic and hard rock to funk and soul to fingerstyle and folk. Lesson topics include songwriting, reading, ear training, rhythmic and melodic dictation, chord and scale application, strumming and picking techniques, singing and playing simultaneously, soloing, and composing. Teaching the theory behind the music that my students enjoy is especially rewarding. Sometimes I even have the honor of helping students with live performances and personal pieces.  
                        </p>
                        <p>Every student has a personal Google Drive folder containing relevant lesson homework, notation, links, and demonstration videos (these make excellent study guides). Documenting this way takes time, but it is a robust study framework, highly organized and accessible from anywhere. Consider lessons with me like a personal college course tailored to your interests. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="quote">"Coire has been working with my daughter in the virtual space for a few months now and it has been nothing short of exceptional.  From the start he has put her musical preferences first to ensure that she is getting what she wants from the lessons.  She looks forward to her lessons weekly with him and even after her lessons she continues to practice without me asking.  What more could a parent want?   He gets how to connect people to their musical preferences to make it fun.  on top of all that he has been great with providing guidance for gear.  This has been very helpful to someone who knows little to nothing about gear." <br>- Ben N.

                        <p>A sixty-minute lesson is optimal for reviewing material, answering questions, and exploring new objectives together, but we can still get a lot done in forty-five minutes. Thirty-minute sessions are best for children and students who can come focused and prepared for smaller steps. If you have any reservations about the remote format, I am happy to meet with you free of charge to answer any questions you might have. If you want to jump right in, the first lesson is half-price.

He has done an excellent job at teaching me the skills to achieve my musical goals (working specific songs, technique, etc.). But most importantly to me, and I wasn’t expecting this, his teaching style has shown me new ways to approach the guitar and music in general.
